        <p>If you don't have a McAfee login account yet, the first step is to create one. Here’s how you can do it:</p>

        <h3>1. Visit the McAfee Website</h3>
        <p>Head over to the official McAfee website (https://www.mcafee.com) using your web browser. Once you are on the homepage, locate the "Sign In" button, usually found at the top right corner.</p>

        <h3>2. Select "Create Account"</h3>
        <p>If you are a new user, click on the “Create Account” button. This will take you to the registration page where you need to enter your details.</p>

        <h3>3. Enter Your Information</h3>
        <p>You will be prompted to enter the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Email Address:</strong> Make sure to use a valid email address. This will be used to send you confirmation emails and updates about your McAfee subscription.</li>
            <li><strong>Password:</strong> Choose a strong, secure password. A mix of letters, numbers, and special characters is recommended for better security.</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> You’ll need to provide your first and last name.</li>
            <li><strong>Subscription Details:</strong> If you already have a McAfee product, you may need to enter the product key or license number, which is typically found in the packaging or in the email you received when purchasing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Verify Your Email</h3>
        <p>After completing the registration, McAfee will send a verification email to the address you provided. Open your email inbox and click the verification link to confirm your account.</p>

        <h3>5. Complete the Setup</h3>
        <p>Once your email is verified, your McAfee login account will be active, and you can start using it to access all the security features that McAfee offers.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: Logging into Your McAfee Account</h2>
        <p>For existing users, logging into your McAfee account is simple. Here’s how you can do it:</p>

        <h3>1. Visit the McAfee Website</h3>
        <p>Go to the official McAfee website (https://www.mcafee.com). Look for the “Sign In” button at the top right corner of the page and click it.</p>

        <h3>2. Enter Your Credentials</h3>
        <p>On the login page, you’ll be prompted to enter your registered email address and password. Make sure to enter the same email and password you used when creating your account.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, users may encounter issues when trying to log into their McAfee account. Here are some common problems and how to resolve them:</p>

        <h3>1. Forgotten Password</h3>
        <p>If you can’t remember your McAfee account password, don’t worry! Simply click on the “Forgot Password?” link located on the login page. McAfee will prompt you to enter your email address, and they’ll send instructions to reset your password. Follow the link in the email to create a new, secure password.</p>

        <h3>2. Incorrect Email Address</h3>
        <p>If you enter the wrong email address during login, you won’t be able to access your account. Double-check that you’re using the correct email address associated with your McAfee account.</p>

        <h3>3. Account Locked</h3>
        <p>If you’ve tried to log in multiple times with incorrect credentials, your McAfee account might get temporarily locked. McAfee will usually send you a notification explaining the issue and how long the lockout will last.</p>

        <h3>4. Two-Factor Authentication</h3>
        <p>McAfee offers an additional layer of security through two-factor authentication (2FA). Make sure you have access to the secondary verification method, such as a phone or authenticator app.</p>
